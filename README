TRIO: Topologies Robustness IndicatOr
Copyright (C) 2014 - SINTEF ICT

TRIO is a simple domain specific language (DSL) used to describe the topology
of software deployment and to gain insight regarding their robustness.

2. HOW TO DOWNLOAD TRIO
-----------------------

Stable releases are available on the Github page of the projects:

    https://github.com/fchauvel/trio/releases


In addition, a binary distribution, continuously updated, is available at:

    http://dist.thingml.org/trio/trio-dist.zip



3. HOW TO RUN TRIO
------------------

Trio is a java application, which should be run from the command line. The 
following example show its primary usage.


Usage: trio [options] input.trio
where 'options' are:
  -o, --observe=TAG  the tag of the components whose activity shall be observed
  -c, --control=TAG  the tag of the components whose activity shall be controlled
  -r, --runs=INTEGER the number of sample for statistical evidence
  -t, --trace=FILE   the file where the generated data shall be stored
Example: trio -o result.csv --run=10000 system.trio


Below is an example of output of succesful invocation

$> java -jar trio-bundle.jar -o service -c infra -t trace.csv samples/sensapp_topo4.trio

SYSTEM: SensApp, topology no. 4
SCENARIO: Robustness of the 'service' layer to failure in the 'infra' layer
INDICATORS:
 + Robustness: 0.0297
 + Five most sensitive components:
   1: 1.7375e+00  VM2
   2: 8.2376e-01  VM1
   3: 6.8183e-01  VM4
   4: 6.6244e-01  VM3
   5: 5.6873e-01  VM5
 + Five most harmful sequences:
   1: 1.9200e-01 [none,  VM2]
   2: 5.6990e-02 [none,  VM3,  VM2]
   3: 5.2990e-02 [none,  VM4,  VM2]
   4: 5.1991e-02 [none,  VM1,  VM2]
   5: 3.1994e-02 [none,  VM5,  VM2]

That's all folks!


4. HOW TO BUILD TRIO
--------------------

$> mvn clean package



5. HOW TO RELEASE TRIO
----------------------

Before to create a release, one should ensure the following:

 - Read/write access to the git repository 

 - Valid credentials to connect on the "deployment" server are
   configured in .m2/settings.xml

The configuration of the SCM maven plugin can be tested using the
following command:

$> mvn scm:validate

Under Windows, one shall set up an ssh agent to avoid that the git
command hang waiting for a passphrase. The following commands are
necessary (run on the git-bash):

$> eval `ssh-agent`
$> env | grep SSH
$> ssh-add "/c/Users/franckc/.ssh/id_rsa"
   enter passphrase : XXXXXXXX

The Maven release plugin can be run in a "dryRun" mode using the
option '-DdryRun=true-'. We recommend to get the 'dry run' before to
run the 'release:prepare' command.

$> mvn --batch-mode release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=0.1 -DdevelopmentVersion=0.2-SNAPSHOT

$> mvn release:perform

If anything goes wrong during the prepare or perform command, on can
revert the info committed in the repository using the following
commands:

$> git reset --hard <id of the commit you want to reset to>
$> git push origin master --force
