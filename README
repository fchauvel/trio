HOW TO BUILD

$> mvn clean package



HOW TO RELEASE
--------------

Before to create a release, one should ensure the following:

 - Read/write access to the git repository 

 - Valid credentials to connect on the "deployment" server are
   configured in .m2/settings.xml

The configuration of the SCM maven plugin can be tested using the
following command:

$> mvn scm:validate

Under Windows, one shall set up an ssh agent to avoid that the git
command hang waiting for a passphrase. The following commands are
necessary (run on the git-bash):

$> eval `ssh-agent`
$> env | grep SSH
$> ssh-add "/c/Users/franckc/.ssh/id_rsa"
   enter passphrase : XXXXXXXX

The Maven release plugin can be run in a "dryRun" mode using the
option '-DdryRun=true-'. We recommend to get the 'dry run' before to
run the 'release:prepare' command.

$> mvn --batch-mode release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=1.0 -DdevelopmentVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT

$> mvn release:perform

If anything goes wrong during the prepare or perform command, on can
revert the info committed in the repository using the following
commands:

$> git reset --hard <id of the commit you want to reset to>
$> git push origin master --force
